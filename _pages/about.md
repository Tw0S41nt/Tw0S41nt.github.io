I am a tenured Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Wright State University. 
I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012, and my M.S. in Systems 
Engineering and B.S. in Computer Science from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 2006 and 2003, respectively. My 
research focuses primarily on computer and network security. In particular, I am interested in building automated, 
effective, and scalable systems for security purposes. My current research focuses on Internet malware analysis, 
detection, and mitigation, Cyber-Physical System Security, and Software Security.
